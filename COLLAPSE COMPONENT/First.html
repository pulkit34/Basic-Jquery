<p>A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects 
that nothing not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape
from inside it.The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass
can deform spacetime to form a black hole.The boundary of the region from which no escape
is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect
on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features
appear to be observed.In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it 
reflects no light
